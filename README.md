# What is Lazuli?

**_Lazuli is a programming language created as a learning experience for myself and is in no way intended as a serious language._** <br/>
The language is called Lazuli because I like the colour blue and apparantly lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt to bring wisdom and this project is ment to give me a better understanding of how compilers work and what is behind a programming language. <br/>
I hope to increase my understaning of Assembly and learn Rust (for the compiler) as it is all the rage these days, it's appearantly a good language for compilers and I have never used it before.

# Platform

Windows 10 x64

# Stuff

This project is inspired by a video I saw on youtube from Pixeled (Let's create a compiler (Pt.1))<br/>

Lazuli will exit with 47 if everthing went well, this is because 47 is the quintessential random number (which now that it is a thing, just google it, will probably only occur more often as a "random" number) and has (since the tv series Fringe, thanks J.J. Abrams) become my favourite number. <br/>
There will be random comments for a while as quick references while I learn Rust and Assembly, that will eventually be removed.

# WIP

More documentation will follow as I continue this project (maybe :D)

# What is Lazuli?

**Lazuli is a programming language created as a learning experience for myself and is in no way intended as a serious language.**
The language is called Lazuli because I like the colour blue and apparantly lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt to bring wisdom and this project is ment to give me a better understanding of how compilers work and what is behind a programming language.

# WIP

More documentation will follow as I continue this project (maybe :D)

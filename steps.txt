Some stuff to help me keep track of what I'm doing and what the steps are, these aren't meant to be instructions for whoever is reading this.

COMPILE ASSEMBLY TO OBJECT FOR WINDOWS (64 bit WINDOWS 10)
    nasm -f win64 -o [out_file].obj [in_file].asm

LINK OBJECT FILE WITH NECESSARY LIBRARIES TO CREATE EXE 
!!DO THIS IN x64 CMD (x64 Native Tools Command Promt for VS 2022)!!
??FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY OR HAVE IT ALWAYS USE 64 BIT SOMEHOW (in VS Code)??
    link [in_file].obj /subsystem:console /out:[out_file].exe kernel32.lib legacy_stdio_definitions.lib msvcrt.lib

cargo run
cargo build

lazuli <path>

CHANGE TO RELEASE, FOR NOW DEBUG
    Add path to lazuli.exe to just run lazuli as command (only once)


CURRENT STEPS:
cd to .\lazuli
cargo build
lazuli .\src\test_lzl\lazuli_test.lzl
.\src\test_lzl\lazuli_test.exe
$LASTEXITCODE

cargo build; lazuli .\src\test_lzl\lazuli_test.lzl; .\src\test_lzl\lazuli_test.exe; $LASTEXITCODE

OR RUN 
.\build_run.bat
